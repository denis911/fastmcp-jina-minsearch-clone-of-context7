TASK: Scrape Web Page MCP Tool

OBJECTIVE
Create a new MCP tool that downloads the content of any web page as Markdown.

SCOPE
- This task applies only to the current repository
- The repository already contains:
  - An MCP starter application
  - A uv-based Python environment
- No changes outside this repository are allowed

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
1. Implement an MCP tool named:
   scrape_web_page

2. Tool behavior:
   - Input: a single URL (string)
   - Output: Markdown content of the page
   - Implementation method:
     - Prepend `https://r.jina.ai/` to the input URL
     - Fetch the content via HTTP
   - Handle HTTP and network errors gracefully

TESTING REQUIREMENTS
1. Create a file named `test.py`
2. `test.py` must:
   - Call the underlying scraping function directly (not via MCP)
   - Retrieve content from:
     https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/minsearch
   - Print and/or log the number of characters returned
3. The test must be runnable by a human using:
   uv run test.py

INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS
1. Register the tool in `repo_docs.py` using FastMCP
2. Ensure the MCP server starts successfully
3. Integrate the server into Antigravity toolchain
4. Update `mcp_config.json` to include the new MCP server

DELIVERABLES
- Updated `repo_docs.py` with the new MCP tool
- New `test.py` file
- Updated `mcp_config.json`

SUCCESS CRITERIA
- `test.py` executes without errors and returns non-empty content
- MCP server starts and exposes scrape_web_page
- The tool can be invoked by an AI assistant
