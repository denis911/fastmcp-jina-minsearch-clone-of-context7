Scrape Web Tool.
Please research the content of the current repo and use AGENTS.md for directions.
Repo consists of MCP starter app and venv for uv environment - please use it.

We need to create an MCP tool for downloading content of any web page.
We'll use Jina reader for that.

To get content of any page in markdown, you simply need to add r.jina.ai 
in front of the address. For example: https://r.jina.ai/https://datatalks.club

Please create an MCP tool based on this. You may use the requests library.

Please test it like that:
-- Create a file `test.py` which invokes requests /  jina-based  function 
to test that it works well.
-- I will run it and check if it works.

-- Integrate scrape_web_page MCP tool into antigravity tool box.
   Update mcp_config.json to include the new server.
